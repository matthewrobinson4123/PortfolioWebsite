            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Matthew Robinson</span> and I am a programmer! I graduated from the University
                of Western Ontario with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I have always had a love for puzzles and in coding I have the opportunity to solve countless puzzles! 
                I've spent my entire life playing video games. As I learned more about programming I discovered that I would pause while playing to try and understand how the 
                code in the game would be written in order for it to work. I have experience with several programming languages from school, however, I have the most experience with
                Object Oriented languages such as Java and Python.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the non-technical side I am eager to learn new things and expand on my current abilities.
                I can work collaboratively with others to achieve company standards and I am very motivated to get work done properly.
                I am passionate about helping to create products that will assist people in their day-to-day lives.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is my hope that from this website you will be able to determine who I am in both a professional and personal sense.
                In the following sections you will see my work history, coding projects, skill set, and hobbies.
                I am very excited to begin my journey into a professional life of software development. Please let me know if you think I'm a good candidate.
                I hope you like what you see and I look forward to discussing any potential positions.
            </p>
