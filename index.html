            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Hi! Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Matthew Robinson</span> and I am a programmer! I graduated from the University
                of Western Ontario with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I have always had a love for puzzles and in coding I have the opportunity to solve countless puzzles! 
                I've spent my entire life playing video games. As I learned more about programming I discovered that I would pause while playing to try and understand how the 
                code in the game would be written in order for it to work. 
            </p>
            <p>
                It is my hope that from this website you will be able to determine who I am in both a professional and personal sense.
                In the following section you will see my work history, coding projects, skillset, and hobbies.
                I strive to be a dedicated and hard-working individual in everything that I do. I will not quit until the task is complete.
                I am very excited to begin my journey into a professional life of software development. Please let me know if you think I'm a good candidate.
                I hope you like what you see!
            </p>
