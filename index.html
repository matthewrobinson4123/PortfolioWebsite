                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    Hello there! Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is <span style="font-weight: bold;">Matthew Robinson</span> and I am a programmer! I graduated from the University
                    of Western Ontario with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. I have always had a love for puzzles and in coding I have the opportunity to solve countless puzzles! 
                    I've spent my entire life playing video games. As I learned more about programming I discovered that I would pause while playing to try and understand how the 
                    code in the game would be written in order for it to work. I have experience with several programming languages from school, however, I have the most experience with
                    Object Oriented languages such as Java and Python.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    On the non-technical side I am eager to learn new things and expand on my current abilities.
                    I can work collaboratively with others to achieve company standards and I am very motivated to get work done properly.
                    I am passionate about helping to create products that will assist people in their day-to-day lives.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    It is my hope that from this website you will be able to determine who I am in both a professional and personal sense.
                    In the following sections you will see my work history, coding projects, skill set, and hobbies.
                    I am very excited to begin my journey into a professional life of software development. Please let me know if you think I'm a good candidate.
                    I hope you like what you see and I look forward to discussing any potential positions.

                                I am an avid fan of board games of all kinds. My all time favourite board game is <span style="font-style: italic;">Axis and Allies: WW1 1914</span>.
                                From my love for board games I have developed a strong sense of strategy. In my collection I have 38 board games, not including expansion sets. My collection includes
                                a wide variety of games differing in length and complexity. Some even offer the ability to play solo. My longest game is <span style-"font-weight: bold;">Twilight Imperium.</span>
                                With maximum player count it can last upwards of 16 hours.

                                In addition to board games, I love video games. I have played video games my entire life, from NES to Xbox One. My preferred gaming platform is PC.
                                I play on a custom built gaming desktop with dual monitors. Through gaming I continue to develop a mind for strategy as well as resource management and teamwork.
                                When I discovered coding and my love for it I found that when I play video games I perceive it how a coder would, thinking about how to code is written, about objects
                                interacting with one another and about efficiency within the applications.

                                One of my more expensive hobbies is buying and painting Warhammer miniatures. I started this hobby in 2014 and have painted on and off since then. I have a skaven
                                (ratmen) and high elf army and I am currently working away at painting a dwarf army. My love of Warhammer and continual practice painting has helped me to develop a
                                keen eye for detail.

                                Fishing has always been a big part of my life. Having a cottage in Northern Ontario has allowed me to enjoy nature and all its beauty. Both my father 
                                and maternal grandfather taught me how to fish and how to appreciate both the sport and the impact on nature. If you've ever been fishing, especially with
                                a hook and worm you know it takes great amounts of patience. I think this learned patience translates into my personal and professional life as well, knowing 
                                the desired end result and understanding that it may not be acheived.
